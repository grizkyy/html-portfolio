<hr />
<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>I love the soundtracks! All the songs are great!</p>
<h3>How Do You Know</h3>
<p>I love the role or the character named George Madison there. The soundtracks are great too but it sucks that there's no soundtrack album of this movie.</p>
<h3>Free Guy</h3>
<p>This is my first Ryan Reynolds movie that I've ever watched. And I love it!</p>
